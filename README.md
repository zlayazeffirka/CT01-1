## Chapter II
## General rules

1. Along the way, you'll feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: this is perfectly normal. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to information sources: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, read it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like this, try to figure it out. If you can't, put it in the list of open questions and you'll find the answer as you go. Don't leave any open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible, remember that it isn't: you're just seeing it that way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter various tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the most meticulous and curious students. These tasks are more difficult and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system or the people around you. After all, you're only fooling yourself.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you ask someone for help, always make sure you understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't help you.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch is ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III
## Market analytics

_Where and how to search for jobs and internship programs?_ 

Job market analysis is the key to finding a job. The analysis will help you understand what positions you are qualified for, what skills you already have, and what skills you need to improve or acquire. Job analysis will help you understand the specifics of a particular position that you like.

_How to conduct such an analysis?_ 

Enter various desired positions in the table and determine which requirements and responsibilities are most common.
[Example of the Market Analysis Table](materials/Анализ_вакансий.xlsx) (available for download in the materials folder -> Анализ_вакансий).

_Why is it necessary to carry out such an analysis?_

1. To have a clear understanding of your future job;
2. To determine what skills are lacking and what needs to be improved;
3. To determine how to gain experience:
    - Find additional training;
    - Gain experience in your current job;
    - Find a mentor who can suggest other actions or provide feedback;
    - Find an internship.

Sometimes, after a well-done analysis, a person realizes that they don't want this job at all and starts looking for something else.

Doing a job market analysis will give you a complete understanding of what you want. Then you can take specific steps to get there.

_Where can you find the resources for finding job openings?_

1. Key Resources:

- HeadHunter is the leading and one of the largest job search resources;
- [Rabota.ru](https://sber.rabota.ru/);
- IT resources: Career.habr.com, tproger, careerspace;
- If you're considering working abroad, you could look at Glassdor and professional social network Linkedin (turn on your VPN).

2. Internship sites: Future Today, BuduJobs, icanchoose and others.
3. Career sites of companies.

**Determine the purpose of your search. Do you plan to work in the Russian market or abroad?** There are different search methods for each option.

In a nutshell, every job search looks like this:

Writing a resume -\> Responding to a job offer -\> Invitation to an interview -\> Rejection or Offer.

But in a global sense, the job search differs from market to market.

**Looking for a job in the Russian market:**

1. Go to the website of the dream company and find the "Jobs" (in Russian: вакансии) or "Careers" (in Russian: карьера, карьера у нас) section, then send a resume and cover letter.
2. Create a resume on hh.ru. You can also leave a reply either to the job offer or to the career site.
3. If the job description includes the recruiter's contact information, you can write a cover letter and send your resume to the recruiter's e-mail or messaging application (during business hours only).
4. Sign up for job alerts.
5. Attend the [One Day Offer](https://developers.sber.ru/portal/events/onedayoffer-june). Similar events are held at other large companies.
6. Almost every company has its own chatbot with job openings on Telegram. Sign up for job offers and don't miss the opportunity to apply.

If it is an international company (even if the office is in Russia), it is better to write a resume in English (especially if the job announcement is also in English):

1. Use the Linkedin professional network (use your VPN) for your job search ([Tips on filling out the profile](https://habr.com/ru/post/464757/)).
2. Answer on the company websites in the "Careers" section.
3. Don't forget about additional foreign job search sites: Glassdor, for example.
4. Subscribe to and monitor the company's job newsletter.

_Common tips for all job search goals:_ 

***Develop networking***:

1. RandomCoffee. Pick communities that interest you, make useful connections, and share experiences. Meet once a week. You'll get a person to meet through a telegram bot (you can choose to do it online or offline). There are also big networking sessions for 20-25 people every 2-3 months.
2. Participate in professional communities (e.g. proftalk, mesto.co) and hackathons. You can follow the [events](https://it-events.com/).

Such meetings will give you new opportunities:

- Useful connections from different companies;
- Job offers;
- Feedback on your resume or test assignment;
- an advanced search for a mentor for yourself.

## Skills Analysis: hard and soft skills
### How to analyze your skills for resume writing

There are several ways to analyze your skills. One of the most popular is the SWOT analysis.

The table can be divided into 4 components. The first two can be determined during job analysis.

1. Strengths:
    - education;
    - experience;
    - skills in the desired field, work results, etc.

2. Weaknesses — Development Area:
    - lack of information and experience;
    - inability to build relationships with management, team, etc.

3. Your capabilities:
    - having the time and motivation to learn new information.

4. Risks or Threats:
    - global situation;
    - obstacles or competitors.

## Analysis of responses and rejections

A job search diary helps you analyze job responses to understand what you can improve in your job search strategy.
 It is important to analyze rejections so that you can react quickly, make changes, and improve your job search strategy.

1. If you find that most rejections are at the "resume review" stage, then you need to rebuild your resume: review the positions, the accomplishments mentioned in the work experience, your portfolio.

2. If there are more rejections after the interview with the hiring manager, then you need to prepare better for the interview:
    - Come up with a better story about yourself;
    - Explore the most common [questions](https://hh.ru/article/303229);
    - prepare for technical questions in the [interview](https://tproger.ru/articles/sobesedovanie-v-it-kompaniju-chto-nuzhno-znat-dzhunioru/).

3. If there are more rejections after technical interviews / tests, pay attention to your hard skills and what needs to be improved.
4. You can also ask for feedback from [mentors](https://getmentor.dev/) in your field or find someone who is already in the position.

## Criteria for selecting a vacancy and a company
### How to make the right choice?

A typical mistake candidates make is to respond to all job postings or all companies in a row. That's not the way to do it. Irrelevant responses will not be reviewed by recruiters.

_Remember your goal and prioritize what you're looking for._ Determine what positions you might be a good fit for based on your experience. Make your job selection checklist. Example criteria:

- High salary;
- Financial stability of the company;
- Career growth;
- Interesting work;
- Great team;
- Work/life balance;
- Good reputation;
- Adoption of high technology;
- Sustainability;
- Involvement in volunteer activities;
- Social package;
- Official employment (for example, under the Labor Code of the Russian Federation), etc.

Once you write down your search criteria, it will be easier to navigate the huge pool of different jobs.

## Analysis of candidate requirements

_What do employers look for?_
Requirements for candidates can be divided into 3 parts:

1. Analyzing the candidate's resume.
2. Analyzing the candidate's soft skills.
3. Analyzing the candidate's hard skills.

**1. Resume Analysis**
Every recruiter always has some sort of personality profile of the candidate for the position they are looking to fill. What might be included in that profile?

- Education;
- Specific skills/technology stack;
- Experience (e.g., startup experience or large company experience is a must);
- Desired salary level;
- Desired work schedule;
- Cover letter;
- Language skills;
- Portfolio, etc.

Based on the candidate's profile, the recruiter tries to find someone who matches the profile as closely as possible and invites them to the first interview stage.

**2. Analyzing the candidate's soft skills**
Soft skills are most often assessed during an interview. Recruiters typically look for competencies such as:

- Communication skills;
- Self-management;
- Thinking (systemic, creative, etc.)
- Management skills;
- entrepreneurial skills, etc.

Skills testing also depends on the position and the candidate's profile. More details about the interview will be provided on DAY 03.

**3. Analyzing the candidate's hard skills**
These skills are tested:

- Through a test task;
- through a technical interview.

One person cannot know everything, but one can strive to continually gain new knowledge and become an expert in one's field. So don't be afraid to make mistakes, take feedback from more experienced colleagues, read more technical literature and solve test tasks, for example: here [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) or here [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) or here [projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Chapter IV
## Task

To solve the problem, you need to decide on a job market and choose Russian or foreign. There is no right or wrong answer to this question. You can use any tools, ask clarifying questions, take notes and draw mind maps to achieve the goal. You should end up with 1-2 vacancies for which you will prepare your resume.

## Chapter V
## Exercise 00
### Company Selection

1. Make your company selection checklist. Be sure to review the Career Wheel exercise from DAY 00 to make sure all the desired criteria are met, and enter this list in Notion (we recommend using this tool). This will be Table #1 (10 criteria and more).
2. Create a list of companies in Notion (board #2) where you would like to work (5 companies and more).
3. On board #3 in Notion, add links to job postings from these companies, if available (3 jobs and more).
4. Subscribe to the career newsletters of 1-2 companies.

## Exercise 01
### Vacancy Analysis

1. Create a spreadsheet called "Vacancy Analysis" (we recommend using Google Sheets).
2. Find at least 7 vacancies and enter them into the spreadsheet.
3. Analyze 7 desirable jobs (you will need to write down all the requirements and responsibilities from the job postings in a spreadsheet).
4. Based on the requirements and responsibilities you wrote down, determine what skills you have and what skills you don't have.
5. If there are requirements and responsibilities for which you do not have the skills, figure out ways to acquire them (training, mentoring, experience in your current position, an internship, a freelance project, etc.).
6. Go back to the career goals table and, based on the analysis of requirements and responsibilities, write down steps to achieve the goals in 2-3 years.

## Exercise 02
### Skills Analysis

1. Draw a SWOT analysis table in MIRO (we recommend the use of this tool).
2. Answer the questions for each box and record your answers in the table:

2.1. Strengths:

- What characteristics set you apart from the rest (skills, training, connections)?
- What resources are available and can be obtained if needed?
- What is your greatest strength as perceived by others?
- What are some of your past accomplishments?

2.2. Weaknesses:

- Are there any tasks you don't like to do?
- What are your qualities that people around you consider your weaknesses?
- Do you have any bad work habits? (Lateness, temper tantrums, lack of stress tolerance, etc.)
- Do you have any character traits that prevent you from moving toward your goal?

2.2. Opportunities:

- What is the current state of your field of activity? What are the advantages?
- What innovative technologies will accelerate the achievement of your goal?
- What changes and patterns are you seeing in the industry and the country as a whole? How will this help you?
- What mistakes can you highlight from the bad experiences of others working in this field?

2.4. Threats:

- What challenges do you face in doing your job?
- Do you have direct competition? (e.g., for promotion)
- Can your weaknesses impede your progress toward your goal?
